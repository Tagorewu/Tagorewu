Recently, I want to do some hardware acceleration applcations like using zynq to mining. This will help me more skillful in software and hardware combinational developments. This type of use case may be used in lot of scenes. Such hardware like DSP, VPU, GPU, neural stick and many fpga cores outside of CPU.

I have to spend some time to read《FPGA based hardware accelerator for Dash mining》this thesis. Let's go...
